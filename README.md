# JAX Accelerated EM for Gaussian Mixture Models
Current repo provides implementation of EM algorithm in JAX using all of the nice just-in-time compilation utilities of this beautiful library, such as:

1. JIT compilation using XLA
2. Using CUDA is easy
3. Analytic Autodiff
4. Easy to use, like Numpy

## Running scripts
All of the code is contained in Jupyter notebook for the ease of visualizations.

## Checkpoints & Data
